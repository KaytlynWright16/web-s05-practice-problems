    PROBLEM 2: Create an h2 element that says "Hello, World" in the HTML above. Using the elements panel again, locate the h1 element and modify its content to say "I'm changing the DOM". If you refresh the page, does the h2 change?

    // h2 does indeed changimg when I refresh the page to add the heading 'Hello, World!'. h1 also changed. 

     /*
    PROBLEM 3: Create a button element that says "Push me" in the HTML above. Using the Elements panel, locate the button element and add a class of "btn" to it. Style the button by adding custom CSS rules within the Styles panel. Does the button still have the styles after a page refresh? Explain your answer.
    */
    //Yes because we are not adding the styles to the html document. The changes will only stay until the page refreshes when making changes to the DOM.
    //work on learning how to change the style via dev tools. 

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Open the Chrome DevTools on any webpage. Using the Elements panel, locate a paragraph element and modify its CSS properties, such as changing the font size, color, or adding a background color. Explain how we are able to make changes on the browser.

    //We are able to make changes to the browser because of the document object at the top of every webpage. This is how developers are given access to the DOM.
    //learn and study this!

    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following code has two bugs that are throwing a Syntax error and a style is not being applied. Find the bugs and code them correctly above in the HTML.

<!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <style>
          .fire {
            background-color: yellow;

        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="myDiv">This div should change color</div>
        <button class='fire'>Change Color</button>
      </body>
    </html>
  */

    //The class .fire should be changed to class='fire'
    //There is a style that is looking for an id of .fire. This should be changed to either #myDiv or .fire to make the yellow background appear.
      //study and learn this.
